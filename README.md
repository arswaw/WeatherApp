# Testing
A basic testing framework has been created for this project.

In keeping with the spirit of NoNode, no testing
framework will be used for this sample project.
In production, the best way to test this
type of app is to find a testing framework that
works natively with ES6 modules, and can be run
from the command line without a package.json

This page will just run some basic tests for static
methods using one or more small datasets.  You can
see the exact code used for each test in /components/tests.js
